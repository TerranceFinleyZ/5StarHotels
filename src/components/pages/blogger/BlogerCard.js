            <k>
As a frequent traveler, I’ve had the pleasure of staying in many hotels around the world. But my recent stay at The Laura Hotel, Houston Downtown, was an experience that stood out. This hotel, part of Marriott’s Autograph Collection, is a gem in the heart of Houston, Texas.

Location
The Laura Hotel is conveniently located in downtown Houston2, directly off Dallas and Main Street. It’s within walking distance to major Houston venues like Minute Maid Park, the Toyota Center, and George R Brown Convention Center. However, be aware that walking around Downtown will expose you to a fair share of homeless people.

Ambiance
The hotel is renowned for its modern and comfortable atmosphere. The minimalist design, distinguished by lofty heights and natural light, is a daydream for any design enthusiast1. The nautical-inspired branding and design throughout the property are a nod to the hotel’s namesake, the Laura - the first steamboat to arrive in Houston.

Amenities
The Laura Hotel offers a variety of amenities that cater to both leisure and business travelers. The rooftop pool with stunning city views is a highlight. They also host pool parties, monthly wine tastings, cigar events, and more. For fitness enthusiasts, there’s a modern fitness center1. The hotel also houses Hull & Oak, a restaurant offering Texas cuisine and tequila cocktails.

Rooms
The rooms at The Laura Hotel are spacious and offer stunning views. They are well-equipped with amenities like allergy-free rooms, blackout curtains, air conditioning, desk, housekeeping, coffee/tea maker, cable/satellite TV, and walk-in shower.

Service
The service at The Laura Hotel is commendable. The staff is service-minded and guides you from the moment you arrive4. However, the valet parking service is a bit pricey at $46 per night.

Conclusion
Overall, my stay at The Laura Hotel, Houston Downtown, was a memorable one. The hotel’s prestigious address, unique touches, and luxury accommodations make it one of the finest hotels in Houston. Whether you’re in town for business or pleasure, The Laura Hotel is a great choice for a comfortable and luxurious stay.
